# Laboratory scale RABR

This repository contains some developments on laboratory-scale Rotating Algal Biofilm Reactor (RABR).
The reactor were build for one of student-projects.

# Content

Folder `electronics` contains the schematics for two designed devices:
- Motor controller for there stepper motors as shaft drives for reactor
- Environment monitor for monitoring conditions of air and light around reactor. This monitor reads:
   - Temperature, Pressure and Relative Humidity of air (with conversion to absolute humidity)
   - Total flux, Photo-synthetically Active Radiation, UV flux.

Folder `models` contains the designer reactor for running in triplicate.

Folder `images` contains CAD renders and photos taken of working reactor and equipment.

# Used tools:
- KiCad : for schematics
- SolidWorks Educational : for designing the reactor
